**MultiTake** is a research project on agent-driven evolving-intent music generation.

The project imagines music generation as a sequence of takes rather than a single prompt-to-file transaction. An external reasoning agent listens to partial generated audio, updates an intent state, and conditions the next continuation step.

## Core Idea

A musician does not finish a track by deciding everything in advance. The direction changes while listening. MultiTake treats that moving intent as the object to model.

The system direction combines:

- iterative generation,
- audio critique,
- intent patches,
- structured session state,
- and a music-generation backbone that can continue from previous material.

## Relationship to DJ Claw

MultiTake is part of the research layer behind the broader personal-radio idea. DJ Claw is the agent/product surface; MultiTake is one possible technical path for making generated music feel more directed, revised, and alive.

## Public Status

This project is listed as a public-facing research dossier. The source repository is private, so the website does not sync its README or expose repository internals.
