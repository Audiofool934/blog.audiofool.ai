**WeaveWave** explores multimodal music generation: turning text, images, and video into music through a shared generative process.

The project uses a text-bridging strategy. A multimodal language model first translates non-audio inputs into rich musical descriptions. Those descriptions then condition a music generation model. This keeps the system modular: new input modalities can be added without rewriting the entire synthesis backend.

## Why It Matters

Music often starts from something that is not music yet: an image, a scene, a memory, a mood, a sentence. WeaveWave treats that pre-musical material as the real starting point.

The project sits close to the larger Audiofool question: how can generative systems carry taste across modalities?

## Direction

WeaveWave is best understood as a bridge project: part multimodal perception, part text-to-music generation, part interface for creative translation.
